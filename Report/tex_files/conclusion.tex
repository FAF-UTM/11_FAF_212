In conclusion, the development of a Domain-Specific Language for analyzing medical results offers a promising solution to the challenges associated with medical data analysis. The DSL is designed to simplify the process of analyzing large volumes of medical data from different sources, improving the accuracy of medical diagnoses and reducing costs in the healthcare industry. Its user-friendly and intuitive nature, combined with a simple user interface, makes it accessible to healthcare professionals who may not have programming skills. \par
Overall, the DSL has the potential to transform the way medical data is analyzed, leading to improved patient outcomes and increased efficiency in the healthcare industry. As such, the development and adoption of this DSL should be a priority for healthcare professionals and organizations looking to improve their medical data analysis capabilities.
