The lexer is converting the content of the file into tokens, the parser is converting these tokens into an abstract syntax tree (AST), and the interpreter is using this AST to print out the results.

The output that you want (the result and reference range for each parameter) is being printed in the interpret function of the interpreter, but it is not being appended to the final output. It looks like the main function only prints the tokens, and does not use the interpreter to generate the results and reference ranges.


Slide 1: Introduction

The DSL is designed for medical result analysis, specifically structured to read and interpret the results of certain medical tests.
Slide 2: Lexer - Tokenization

The Lexer is responsible for tokenizing the input. It recognizes identifiers (like "patient", "dob", "test"), strings, numbers, and special symbols (like ":", "{", "}", and newlines)​1​.
The lexer uses classes such as Token and Lexer. The Token class is initialized with a type and literal, while the Lexer class contains methods to advance through the input string, skip whitespace, and identify identifiers, strings, and numbers​1​.
Slide 3: Interpreter

The interpreter takes the tokens generated by the lexer and processes them according to predefined parameters for different types of medical tests including CBC (Complete Blood Count), Lipid profile, and CMP (Comprehensive Metabolic Panel) tests​2​.
It evaluates the test results against reference ranges and provides comments and diagnostics based on whether the results are within, below, or above the normal range. It also offers general health care tips and the suggestion to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options​2​.
Slide 4: Parser

I was not able to fully explore the parser's functionality due to time constraints. However, the parser typically takes the tokens from the lexer and arranges them into a structured format (usually an Abstract Syntax Tree or AST), which can then be processed by the interpreter.
Slide 5: Possible Features to Add

Incorporating more medical tests: Currently, the DSL is designed to interpret CBC, Lipid profile, and CMP tests. Additional medical tests could be incorporated to expand the utility of the DSL.
Adding a data visualization feature: Currently, the DSL provides textual comments and diagnostics. A data visualization feature could be added to graphically represent the patient's results in relation to the normal ranges.
Customizable reference ranges: The reference ranges are currently hardcoded in the interpreter. A feature could be added to allow healthcare professionals to set their own reference ranges based on their clinical judgement and the specific circumstances of their patients.
Please note that the information about the parser is incomplete, and a more in-depth analysis of the parser's functionality would be beneficial for a comprehensive understanding of the DSL.
